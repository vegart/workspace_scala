  Huffman Code
  First of all, consult a good book on discrete mathematics or algorithms for a detailed description of Huffman codes!
    We suppose a set of symbols with their frequencies, given as a list of (S, F) Tuples. E.g. (("a", 45), ("b", 13), ("c", 12), ("d", 16), ("e", 9), ("f", 5)). Our objective is to construct a list of (S, C) Tuples, where C is the Huffman code word for the symbol S.

    scala> huffman(List(("a", 45), ("b", 13), ("c", 12), ("d", 16), ("e", 9), ("f", 5)))
  res0: List[String, String] = List((a,0), (b,101), (c,100), (d,111), (e,1101), (f,1100))
